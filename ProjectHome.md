What is this?
This is the software behind the 2011 YouTube Symphony Orchestra's AR 'Experiment.' The Experiment is an innovative augmented-reality musical instrument brought to you by Hyundai and YouTube. You can see it in action here: http://www.youtube.com/symphony?x=experiment

The full source for the performance interface (the augmented reality application that actually makes the music) is available in the Downloads section, or through the Source repository.

This instrument was a collaboration between YouTube, Tellart and Hyundai.

The augmented reality instrument uses the FLARManager & FLARtoolkit both available under the GPL license.
